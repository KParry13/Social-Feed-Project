// Create a template of how you would like each individual post to be displayed. 
// This will include the user’s name, the body of the post, and the “like” and “dislike” buttons.

// Lastly, you will need to build out the “like” and “dislike” functionality. 
// Within the Post component, create 2 separate functions – one for when the “like” button is clicked, 
// and one for when the “dislike” button is clicked. 
// Bind these functions to their respective buttons onClick event. 
// Within these functions, start to lay out the steps that need to occur when each button is clicked.

            <tr>Name</tr>
            <tr>Post</tr>
        </table>
     );
